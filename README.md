======

twitpersonality implements a supervised learning approach to compute personality traits by only relying on what an individual tweets about publicly. The approach segments tweets in tokens, then it learns word vector representations as embeddings that are then used to feed a supervised learner classifier. 

How to Use
----
twitpersonality needs to learn from examples, first thing is to read [training](https://github.com/D2KLab/twitpersonality/tree/master/Training). 

Once the models are created, then you can do some tests, please refer to [test](https://github.com/D2KLab/twitpersonality/tree/master/Test)
