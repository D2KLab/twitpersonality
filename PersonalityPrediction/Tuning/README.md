Parameters' tuning for Machine Learning Models
======
Python 3 scripts to test machine learning models with different parameters and measure their accuracy

Description
-----
For simplicity, it is provided a bash script <tt>extensiveTuning_OCEAN.sh</tt> that handles all the required programs' launches.

The script tests two different Machine Learning techniques: LASSO and Support Vector Machines.
Moreover, for each of the two mentioned techniques, the following method for computing word embeddings are tested:
  *<b>Sum</b> \t asd
  *<b>Max</b> asd
  *<b>Min</b>
  *<b>Average</b>
  *<b>Concatenation</b>
  
  
  

```
